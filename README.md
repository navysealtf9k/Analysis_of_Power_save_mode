# Analysis_of_Power_save_mode
This repository details my final project for UBC's design of experiments course ( [STAT 404](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=STAT&course=404)). In this project, my team and I investigated if a phone's power save mode had a statistically significant effect on reducing its battery's average drain time.


# REPO Contents
This repo contains three folders. They are:

Folder Name | Description | Link
:------------ | :------------------------ | :----------------------------------:
Code | This folder is our codebase. It contains different R scripts (with detailed comments) I wrote to perform our analysis and generate our findings. | [Click here](https://github.com/navysealtf9k/Analysis_of_Power_save_mode/tree/master/Code)
Data | This folder holds data manually collected from multiple experimental runs. It's contents allows readers to reproduce our work.| [Click here](https://github.com/navysealtf9k/Analysis_of_Power_save_mode/tree/master/Data)
